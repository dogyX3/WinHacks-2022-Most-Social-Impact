* The plan is to create an app in rust, that is simple/easy and quick to use, providing information to anyone
    about the location of trouble makers on the streets.
* At minimum, it will have a 1-5 rating buttons, to rate the severity of the danger posed by the trouble
    makers
* Just press one of those, and submit, to notify anyone looking at the in-app map, of the
    location of the roaming kids.

* This app allows people outside, who want to avoid trouble to avoid areas, where there are kids like this.
* Also the app allows the position of trouble makers to be tracked, as residents nearest the kids use the app
    as the kids get closer to their residence.
* Such information can also be valuable as evidence to the local council, to get focussed police patrols in
    the area

* Additionally, the app will also have tick boxes, containing the characteristics of the group, such as:
    - Large Group
    - Shouting
    - Drunk
    - Violent/Fighting
    - Destructive/Vandlism
    - Loud Music
    - Carrying Weapons
    - Other _____
    - etc.

* That way, when somebody is judging whether they wish to go through such a group, they can choose whether,
    they are willing to or not
